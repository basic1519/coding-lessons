        <h1 style= "color:Black;"> The Life of a tycoon in the area on SMM and the digital world</h1>
        <p style= "color: black;"> Being a tycoon in the industry is an amazing feeling!!<br>
        It's been an exciting, but bumpy road, filled with moments of fear, failure, success,and life lessons a person can only learn from experience.<br>
        Growing up, Iwas always told by my grandpa that I shoukd akways work hard and never give up!Those words really stuck with me untill today, and will continue to be ith me for the rest of my life.<br>
        If there is any young person aspairing to be great in the area of SMM, my advice to you would simply be, never give up, and always invest in yourself!<br>
        Remember, that failure is an important ingredient for success, it doesn't define who you are, or what you can achieve in life.<br>
        Failure only means that something wasn't right the first time, and you need to fix that.<br>
        I remember my first client was my own grandpa. I am so happy that he gave me the platform to improve my marketing skills and in my business skills in general.<br>
        I will never forget what he did for me.One fundamental thing to take with you is that working alone and being independant is good  and all, but when you partner with someone else, you have so much more reach,<br>
        and a better chance at succeeding in life. I personally thank a good friend of mine, Ndeda Kaduki. I remember when i was just starting out as an entrepreneur, i would always ask him for help either with a website,<br>
        a logo, or even advice on other topics. Even when i was just starting my first ever SMMA, he was  there from the start helping me when there was too much on my plate, he was and always will be a special persin to me<br>
        because i know without his support, i never would have made ot this far, and i never woukd have been able to land so many bookings in one day!! One can chase a thousand, but two can chase ten thousand!!<br>
        So, Ndeda thank you sooo much, I will always rememner you for the rest of my life.And, because you give so much to people, you will never lack anything you need.
